Limitations
***********

Currently, the module is still under development with the following limitations:

*  So far, the module only supports `"a"` as the variable.
*  Because the module heavily depends on regular expressions,
   the user needs to follow the format of the
   equation carefully, or the module might break.
*  The equation must be uni-variate, i.e., there can only be one independent
   variable.
